# I learn Java

In this repository, I documented what I have been learn in Java, especially OOP and Data Structures.

Source I've been using for this repo from here:
- [playlist OOP kunal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSVKUk58K6U&list=PL9gnSGHSqcno1G3XjUbwzXHL8_EttOuKk)
- [playlist Java PZN](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-CtdCApEFH-p_Q2GyK4K3ORoAT0Yt7CX)

Currently, I learn about the OOP in Kunal playlist, then I learn the collection in PZN Java playlist.
